Photography website for code institute pp1

Deciding to make a photography Website with a Gallery, About and a contact section I will be using HTML CSS and Balsamiq for the wireframe, I have constructed a basic wireframe using balsamiq to get the basic format in I have included these in the "read-me-docs" 

included CDN for font awesome, added placeholder for logo. Trying to insert background image i think I have the right CSS but it's not showing not sure if its to do with file size and loading times. going to look into this more.

added footer links for social media.

started to work on the styling fixed the broken links, had the text not in the <a> tags also fixed styling for css. noticed i hadn't put the direct file path in.
added border radius to nav links to make it look more appealing still figuring out how to make the nav bar not take the full top header, tried positioning etc. still figuring out.

managed to get the nav bar looking somewhat relative to my wireframe still currently working on the styling going to be adding in the footer soon, feeling overwhelmed with the nav bar.

worked on hero-text and positioned it into the middle of the page.

working on styling footer to have text items go from left to right instead of a list 

managed to add my background image to the webpage I was using the wrong file path should have been ../ and not url() positioning is still a bit off so going to work on that 

managed to make background color a bit darker using code from chat gpt code ( body::before {
    content: "";
    position: absolute;
    top: 0;
    right: 0;
    bottom: 0;
    left: 0;
    background: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); 
    z-index: -1;
  })

  Had to move back to code anywhere because of gitpod.io limit 

  imported google fonts link and removed background color from nav bar and added a border. 

  managed to hide the scroll bar with the overflow:hidden on my background image 
  removed the text decoration from gallery text and added about page, going to change the design for about and add a packages section and about me section about photographer. 

  added a contact form still need to style. 
  also added more pages and set the action of the form to "mail to" still having trouble with codeanywhere being slow.

  Still working on basic structure getting everything positioned and then will begin styling.

  The objective of the webpage is to get more bookings and advertise the photographers work.

  To do this im creating a website including a gallery and a contact form also an about section to get to know the photographer.

the functional specs and content required will be a contact form requiring name and email and a short message.

Im also considering adding different package options to the form which will be seperated into Headshots, landscape and weddings, I will include a radio form in my contact form to achieve this
