Deciding to make a photography Website with a Gallery, About and a contact section I will be using HTML CSS and Balsamiq for the wireframe, I have constructed a basic wireframe using balsamiq to get the basic format in I have included these in the "read-me-docs" 

included CDN for font awesome, added placeholder for logo. Trying to insert background image i think I have the right CSS but it's not showing not sure if its to do with file size and loading times. going to look into this more.

added footer links for social media
