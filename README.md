# Winterburn Photography

Winterburn Photography is a website showcasing, recent work by the photographer, giving information about the packages they offer, what work they have recently done shown by a gallery, customer reviews and showing how you can get in touch. In the website the user will learn how to get in touch with the contact page, what equipment can be used and what the results look like with the gallery page, learn what packages are currently on offer with time frames with the amount of hours shown on the page in the package cards and how many photos they can choose to have, on the main index page the user will learn what the website is about and what previous customers have said about their photography experience with Winterburn Photography.

# User Stories


# Planes
### Strategy Plane
The site objectives are to showcase what Winterburn Photography can provide with a Gallery and equipment list also to show users where they can get in touch if they want any photos taken in the future and also a package list to show what different photography packages that the company has to offer. 

### Scope Plane 
To achieve the websites objectives to navigate through the different pages of the website it will need a Navigation bar, I've included a Header with a clickable link to take you back to the main page aswell. The website also needs a gallery section to showcase the photographers work with an information bar underneath the gallery section to show what equipment the company has to offer. It will also need a contact form for the users to communicate directly with the owner to organise a photo shoot. Package cards will also be created to show the user what different packages the company has on offer.

### Surface Plane 
The main design for the website will have the font color in #fff and background elements in rgba(26, 24, 21, 0.733) to make the text stand out and be visually appealing the main body of the page will feature an image taken by the photographer to make it more streamlined for the companies purpose. The main font will be "poppins" because that is a common and nice font family. For the mobile design all content will be centered so it is an easy scrollable experience for the user and the desktop page will be more spaced out between elements so the seperate content can breathe a little. 


 # WireFrames Desktop

    Here is the wireframe for the main index page, it is a bit different from the final result as the website wasn't mobile friendly at the start so I modified it to make it more mobile friendly.

2. permanent footer at the bottom of the page to display the copyright and social media links that open up with seperate tabs using the target \_blank attribute.
   ![image](documents/footer.jpg "footer")
3. A contact form to get in touch with the company including name, email and message with the form set to required so the user can't send blank messages name or invalid email address. The original structure of the form was borrowed from chat.gpt but the whole styling got changed due to aesthetic not fitting with the webpage. Responsive on different devices, Achieved by media queries.

4. A gallery so the user can look at the recent images that the company has produced and encourages the user to have more incentive to get in touch with the company. The gallery is fully responsive on all devices.

## Future features
 For the future features I would like to add a shop page to the website where the user can click on the image and buy the image from the website and for it to be printed onto a canvas.

### Navigation Bar
To manual test the navigation bar links you will need to click on the navigation bar links and see if they take you to the right page.
*Gallery should take you to the "gallery page" where you will see the gallery and equipment list.
*Packages should take you to the "packages page" where you will see the different packages on offer for the website.
*Contact should take you to the "contact page" where you will see the contact form and contact numbers and address for the company.
*To get back to the main page you will need to click on "Winterburn Photography" in the header and that should take you back to the main page. 
They should work on each indvidual page you click on.

### Footer links 
To manual test the footer links, you should click on the footer logos.
*The Facebook logo should take you to Facebook.
*The Instagram logo should take you to Instagram.
*The YouTube logo should take you to YouTube.

These should work for all different pages e.g. if they work on the main page they should work for the Gallery page etc.

Note that these will just take you to the landing page as there is no actual social media sites for Winterburn Photography.

*Go to "contact" on the navigation bar
*Fill out the form with everything filled in including a valid "@" email.
