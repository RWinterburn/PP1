3. A contact form to get in touch with the company including name, email and message with the form set to required so the user can't send blank messages name or invalid email address. The original structure of the form was borrowed from chat.gpt but the whole styling got changed due to aesthetic not fitting with the webpage. Responsive on different devices, Achieved by media queries.
